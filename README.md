## DevOps Pipeline

Automated development process of the system.

1. Releases.
    - Releases are automated using GitHub Actions. Go through [this guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-dev-docs/blob/docs/hub/apps/package-and-deploy/ci-for-winui3.md) and [workflow file](.github/workflows/production-winui3-fooddesire-dotnet-desktop.yml).
    - Installing.
        - Before installing the MSIX package, it is important to ensure that the certificate is installed in the system. This will allow the package to be trusted and installed    correctly. [Installing a test certificate directly from an MSIX package.](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/install-test-certificate-from-msix.html)
        - It is important to note that the IMS app requires the use of [.NET user secrets](Src/FoodDesire.AppSettings/README.md#setting-environment-variables) on the client system. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access and use the app.

2. Hosting.
    The web app is hosted on Azure App Service. GitHub Actions is used to automate the deployment process. Go through [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/devops/github-actions-overview) and [workflow file](.github/workflows/production-web_app-fooddesire-web-sea-dev-001.yml).

Each of these steps is followed by automated testing to ensure that the app is functioning correctly. Go through [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/devops/dotnet-test-github-action) and [workflow file](.github/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml).
          > I no longer have access to the student email which had a free Azure subscription. So the production environment is no longer available.
